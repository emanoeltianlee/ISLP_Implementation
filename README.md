ISL Implementations

Friends, I am attempting to re-implement from scratch all (?) of the statistical learning algorithms that are found or even mentioned in passing in the book Introduction to Statistical Learning, whose authors are too numerous for me to name. In that great work, the authors remark that:

"While it is important to know what job is performed by each cog, it is not necessary to have the skills to construct the machine inside the box!"

I am of quite the opposite opinion. I have aimed to reconstruct the learning algorithms to the best of my ability, without having recourse to invoke the well-known and important ML libraries of our day.
